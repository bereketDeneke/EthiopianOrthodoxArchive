Based on your description, I refined the README to match the context of building a project for the Christian community. This version reflects the specific purpose of improving the user experience of the Ethiopian Orthodox website and integrates features like API requests for religious content.

# Ethiopian Orthodox Archive Project

This project is a React-based web application designed to enhance the user experience of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church website. The existing website isn't user-friendly or welcoming, so this project aims to create a more accessible, modern, and interactive platform for those who want to learn more about Orthodox Christianity. It uses API integration to provide real-time content and create a space for users to ask questions and access historical religious archives.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to make the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's resources more accessible and interactive, with features that allow users to explore religious texts, ask questions, and receive informative responses. This application supports members of the Christian community or anyone interested in learning about the Orthodox faith by offering a streamlined interface and educational tools.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Redesigned for easy navigation, making it more welcoming for visitors.
- **AskAI Integration:** Users can ask religious or faith-based questions and get responses using the integrated AI system.
- **Access to Historical Archives:** Explore the vast collection of Ethiopian Orthodox Church documents and texts.
- **Music & Scripture Player:** Listen to religious music and view scriptures in a clean and intuitive player.
- **Calendar for Holy Days:** Access a detailed calendar for religious events and holidays.

## Technologies Used
- **React** (bootstrapped with Create React App)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Node.js** for the backend server
- **Fetch API** for retrieving data from an external API
- **Netlify Functions** for serverless API requests

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Steps to Setup and Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bereketDeneke/EthiopianOrthodoxArchive.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd EthiopianOrthodoxArchive
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

5. **Build the app for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Available Scripts

- **`npm start`:** Runs the app in development mode.
- **`npm test`:** Launches the test runner.
- **`npm run build`:** Builds the app for production.
- **`npm run eject`:** Removes the Create React App build tool.

## API Integration

The application uses a Netlify serverless function to interact with AI via the AskAI feature. This feature allows users to ask questions about religious topics and receive automated responses. 

### Example API Call:
```javascript
const fetchAIResponse = async (prompt) => {
  const serverlessUrl = '/.netlify/functions/askAI'; // Your Netlify serverless function
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(serverlessUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt, apiKey })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    setResponse(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching AI response:', error);
    setResponse('Error fetching response. Please check your API key or try again.');
  }
};
```

## AI Assistance

ChatGPT was used throughout the development process to:
- Assist in designing the React structure.
- Optimize the layout and API integration.
- Troubleshoot CORS and API issues related to the `fetch` method.

All AI-assisted code has been reviewed and adapted for this project’s needs.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:
```
/src
  /components
    Header.js
    PlaylistDrawer.js
    PDFReader.js
  /pages
    Home.js
    Archives.js
    AskAI.js
    MusicPlayer.js
  /utils
    ArchiveHelper.js
    PlaylistHelper.js
  App.js
  index.js
```
- `components/`: Reusable UI elements like headers and players.
- `pages/`: Different pages, including Home, Archives, and the AskAI feature.
- `utils/`: Helper functions for fetching and processing data.

## File Structure

The current file structure also contains the following directories:

```
